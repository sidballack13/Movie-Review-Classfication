## Movie Reviews Classification

### Overview:
- The objectives of this assignment are as follows:
- Implement the Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm</li>
- Handle text data (movie reviews)
Design and engineer features from text data. Choose the best model i.e., parameters of the Nearest Neighbor algorithm,
features and similarity functions.

### Detailed Description:
A practical application in e-commerce applications is to infer sentiment (or polarity) from
free-form review text submitted for a range of products. For the purposes of this assignment, you have to implement a k-Nearest Neighbor
Classifier to predict the sentiment for 15000 reviews for movies provided in the test file (test_file.txt). Positive sentiment is represented by a review rating of +1 and negative
sentiment is represented by a review rating of -1. In the test file, you are only provided the reviews but no ground truth rating which will be
used for comparing your predictions. Training data consists of 15000 reviews and exists in the file train _file.txt. Each row begins with the sentiment score followed by the text of
the review.
